What is Alt text?
---

**Alternative (Alt) Text** is a brief, descriptive text that provides an alternative to visual content.

Imagine that you have a student with visual impairments, and the student uses a screen reader.
!



You included an image on your course slides, and the screen reader will attempt to read the Alt Text added to the image. If you did not add an alt text, or if the alt text is not helpful, the student will not be able to understand the content fully.

By incorporating Alt Text, instructors can create more accessible, inclusive, and effective learning experiences for all students.

> #### Screen Reader
> A screen reader is a type of assistive technology that reads aloud the text and descriptions of images that are displayed on a computer screen.  They are essential for blind or visually impaired people to access and interact with computers and digital content.
