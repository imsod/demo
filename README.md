## Learning Objectives
Through this page, you will learn how to: 
  - describe what **Alt Text** is.
  - write effective **Alt Text**.

What is Alt Text?
---

**Alternative (Alt) Text** is a brief, descriptive text that provides an alternative to visual content.

Consider this real-world example: 

You have a student who is visually impaired and relies on a screen reader to access content.

![a student wearing sunglasses and headphones in the computer lab](images/image-student_using_screen_reader.png)

You included an image on your course slides, and the screen reader will attempt to read the Alt Text added to the image. If you did not add an alt text, or if the alt text is not helpful, the student will not be able to understand the content fully as sighted students would do.

By incorporating Alt Text, instructors can create more accessible, inclusive, and effective learning experiences for all students.

> #### What is Screen Reader?
> A screen reader is a type of assistive technology that reads aloud the text and descriptions of images that are displayed on a computer screen.  They are essential for blind or visually impaired people to access and interact with computers and digital content.

Writing Effective Alt Texts
---

Then, how can we write a good Alt Text? 

Consider these guidelines:
- Brevity is key: Aim for 1-2 sentences.
- Highlight essential details: Describe critical aspects of the image, such as the environment, actions, interactions, and facial expressions.
- Avoid Redundant Phrases: Refrain from starting with "an image of" or "a picture of."
- Specify the Type: Mention if the image is a logo, painting, cartoon, diagram, or chart.
- For Decorative Images: If the image is purely decorative (e.g., stylistic borders), mark it as "decorative" or leave the alt attribute empty.

Here are some examples.

![A student is sitting at a classroom table, holding a pen with a thick book and a notebook in front of him. About ten other students are sitting at their desks, listening to the instructor at the front of the room.](images/image-students_in_classroom.jpg)

Alt text: "A student is sitting at a classroom table, holding a pen with a thick book and a notebook in front of him. About ten other students are sitting at their desks, listening to the instructor at the front of the room."


![Multiple rows of sunflowers in a large field.](images/image-sunflowers_field.jpg)

Alt text: "Multiple rows of sunflowers in a large field."


![decorative](images/image-decortaive.jpg) 

Alt text: "Decorative."
